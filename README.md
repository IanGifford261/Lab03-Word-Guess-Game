## Description

This is a C# console application that will prompt a user with the normal ATM menu that you would find at an ATM. There are multiple choices that you can pick such as "View Balance, Withdraw, Deposit, and exit."
A user can select each option while "withdrawing"/"depositing" currency and having it update.
